# Blackjack Game - README

## Project Overview
This project is a digital implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. It simulates an interactive game between a player and a dealer, adhering to standard Blackjack rules. The objective is for the player to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

## Features
- Interactive gameplay between a player and a dealer.
- Dynamic handling of actions such as "Hit" (draw a card) or "Stand" (keep current hand).
- Automatic evaluation of win/loss conditions based on Blackjack rules.
- Encapsulation of game components (Deck, Hand, Card) for modularity and maintainability.

## Technical Highlights
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Design Principles**:
  - Encapsulation: Ensures each class manages its properties and methods independently.
  - Low Coupling: Minimal dependencies between classes for ease of maintenance.
  - Cohesion: High focus on single responsibilities per class.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Deck Class**: Builds, shuffles, and deals cards.
  - **Hand Class**: Represents the player's and dealer's hands, calculates total values.
  - **Card Class**: Represents individual playing cards.
  - **BlackjackGame Class**: Manages overall game flow.
